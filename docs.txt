As you can see, first we set up a WebSocket route (/media-stream) to handle media streaming between Twilio and OpenAI. This is the route we referenced in our TwiML, above. The next two areas require more explanation.

Set up the OpenAI Realtime API Session and Conversation
Next, we set up our Session configuration with OpenAI. This configuration is sent to the OpenAI WebSocket as a JSON object after the connection opens, after a slight delay. We use the sendSessionUpdate() function to define how the AI interacts and responds. You can read more about the options I chose in the OpenAI Realtime API documentation.

The sendSessionUpdate function also configures the OpenAI session attributes:

turn_detection: Enables server-side Voice Activity Detection (VAD).
input_audio_format / output_audio_format: Specifies audio formats, which we changed to g711_ulaw due to Twilio requirements.
voice: Sets the AI voice to 'alloy' (or however you set the constant).
instructions: Influences AI interaction using SYSTEM_MESSAGE.
modalities: Enables both text and audio communication.
temperature: Controls randomness in AI responses.
Proxy between the Twilio and OpenAI WebSockets
The following lines proxy audio data (using Twilio-supported G.711 u-law format) between the Twilio Media Stream and OpenAI Realtime AI WebSocket connections. When the call starts, this is where the caller's voice is processed, and the AI-generated audio is streamed back.

Here's a detailed walkthrough of how we are proxying between OpenAI Realtime and Twilio:

start event: Captures the stream's unique ID (streamSid).
media event: media event: Processes and forwards audio data payloads from the ongoing call to OpenAI.
response.audio.delta: Handles AI-generated audio data from OpenAI, re-encodes it, and sends it to Twilio.
Twilio WebSocket close event: Handles client disconnection and closes streams.
